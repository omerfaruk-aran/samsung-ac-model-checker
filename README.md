# Samsung AC Model Checker

This project helps you check if your Samsung AC model is classified as NASA, Non-NASA, or Other based on the model number.

## Usage

1. Go to the [Samsung AC Model Checker Page](https://omerfaruk-aran.github.io/samsung-ac-model-checker).
2. Enter your model number (e.g., `AJ050NCJ2EG`) in the input field.
3. Click the "Check Model" button to see the classification.

## How It Works

The model number is analyzed based on specific characters:
- **NASA**: Indoor units that are classified as NASA.
- **Non-NASA**: Outdoor units or other indoor units not classified as NASA.
- **Other**: If the model does not fit the typical classification pattern.
